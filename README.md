# 🧩 Problem Solver | 🚀 AI & Automation Enthusiast | 🎨 Indie Maker | 🔧 Self-Hosting Advocate

## About Me

I'm a .NET Developer and Azure DevOps Engineer at **Xebia Poland**, based in Gliwice, Poland. I'm passionate about all things **AI**, **DevOps**, and building indie software projects. As an enthusiast of LLMs, Generative AI, and automation, I constantly explore new tools and technologies (often fueled by a bit too much coffee ☕). I love solving problems and automating tasks with creative solutions whenever possible.
